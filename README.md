### Description:

In this project we worked with semantic HTML tags, \<header\>, \<main\> and \<footer\>, grouped and positioned elements by using grid layouts.

We created a blue printed of the website and used grayscale colors to build the original page's heatmap. The darker tones of grays are for striking elements and the lighter ones are for the most inconspicuous. 

We made some writings on those strikings parts with \<h1\> elements and we used font-style from google fonts named 'Manjari'.
